This first round of combat should be easy enough, as long as you aren’t deathly afraid of bushes or anything. Choose your spell from the list below, and it will call a Method (the spell you chose) on an Object (the bush). This is a great example of utilizing the basic building blocks that make up coding. At least, that’s what the guy who wrote the code thinks. Don’t worry for this level, it is impossible for you to lose here!", encounter_id: 1)

One of the key aspects of programming with Objects we will focus on is Attributes. Future versions of this game will hopefully give this more justice than I can currently fit in the limited window I have here, but attributes can be used to track any kind of data you want stored within that object. You’ll notice as combat continues that the enemy is missing, and it prompts you to use the “Inspect” spell. This will read out some of the attributes we have associated with this Object to help give us the details that make them a “creature” instead of a “line of words and symbols” like code tends to look.", encounter_id: 2)

In the previous encounter the bat had an attribute called “stealth”, and we set up a series of code so that when the player casts Inspect it switches the monster’s stealth attribute to visible, allowing players to target them. For this encounter try to inspect and look at the “Element” attribute. The game has been designed to recognize the element of each spell and monster when they interact and adjust damage accordingly.
